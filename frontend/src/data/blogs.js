      "The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, commonly known as RERA, has revolutionized the Indian real estate sector by bringing transparency and accountability to property transactions.",
      "RERA mandates that all real estate projects must be registered with the regulatory authority. This ensures that buyers have access to complete project information, including approvals, timelines, and financial details.",
      "One of the key benefits of RERA is the protection it offers to home buyers. Developers are now required to deposit 70% of the funds collected in a separate escrow account, which can only be used for that specific project.",
      "RERA also establishes strict timelines for project completion and provides a mechanism for grievance redressal. Buyers can file complaints with the RERA authority if developers fail to meet their commitments.",
      "Before purchasing any property, always verify the RERA registration number and check the project details on the official RERA website. This simple step can save you from potential fraud and ensure a secure investment."

      "From an investment perspective, apartments in prime locations often offer better liquidity and rental yields. Villas typically appreciate more in the long term but may take longer to sell.",
      "Consider your lifestyle, family size, budget, and long-term plans before making a decision. Visit multiple properties, talk to existing residents, and evaluate the total cost of ownership including maintenance and taxes."

      "Vastu Shastra, the ancient Indian science of architecture, continues to influence property buying decisions. While modern buyers may not follow all principles strictly, certain Vastu guidelines remain popular.",
      "The main entrance should ideally face north, east, or northeast for positive energy flow. Avoid south-facing entrances if possible, though this can be balanced with proper Vastu remedies.",
      "The master bedroom should be in the southwest corner for stability and prosperity. Kitchen placement in the southeast is considered auspicious, as this direction is associated with the fire element.",
      "Living rooms in the north or east promote social harmony and positive interactions. Avoid placing toilets in the northeast corner, as this is considered the most sacred direction.",
      "While Vastu can guide your choices, don't let it override practical considerations like location, budget, and legal compliance. Many modern architects successfully blend Vastu principles with contemporary design."
