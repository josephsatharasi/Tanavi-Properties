# Mobile Upload Fix - "Failed to fetch"

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend CORS Fix (`backend/server.js`)
- Added explicit CORS headers for mobile browsers
- Added OPTIONS preflight handling
- Set `credentials: false` to avoid mobile CORS issues

### 2. Upload Route Fix (`backend/routes/upload.js`)
- Added OPTIONS handler for preflight requests
- Explicit CORS headers on upload endpoint

### 3. Frontend Upload Fix (`frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.js`)
- Added `mode: 'cors'` and `credentials: 'omit'`
- Added image compression before upload
- Better mobile network handling

### 4. Image Compression (`frontend/src/utils/imageCompressor.js`)
- Compresses images before upload
- Reduces file size for mobile networks
- Resizes large images automatically

## Deploy Steps

### 1. Redeploy Backend
```bash
cd backend
git add .
git commit -m "Fix mobile CORS"
git push
```

Your hosting (Render) will auto-deploy.

### 2. Rebuild Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Redeploy to your hosting (Vercel/Netlify).

### 3. Test on Mobile
1. Clear mobile browser cache
2. Close and reopen browser
3. Login to admin
4. Try uploading image
5. Wait 60 seconds

## Why It Failed on Mobile Only

Mobile browsers handle CORS differently:
- Stricter security policies
- Different preflight request handling
- Network timeouts on slower connections
- Credentials handling differs

## Alternative: If Still Fails

### Option 1: Use Direct Cloudinary Upload
Instead of uploading through backend, upload directly to Cloudinary from frontend.

### Option 2: Use Base64
Convert image to base64 and send as JSON (not recommended for large images).

### Option 3: Test with Smaller Image
Try uploading a very small image (under 500KB) first.

## Quick Test

After deploying, test with:
1. Small image (under 1MB)
2. On WiFi (not mobile data)
3. Wait full 60 seconds
4. Check browser console for errors

## If Error Persists

Check mobile browser console:
1. Open site on mobile
2. Enable "Desktop site" mode
3. Open developer tools
4. Look for actual error message
5. Share the error for more specific fix
